When you receive your Microsoft Office Key card, it may be necessary for you to turn the card over and gently scratch off the silver foil that is on the back in order to reveal your product key. 

Keep in mind that a product key may also have barcodes and other groups of letters and numbers that may seem confusing. 

However, your product will always be shown in the form of:office.com/setup or microsoft.com
office.com/setup or microsoft.com
